      <h2>Breaking the Cycle: From Cram → Pass → Forget</h2>
      <p>
        In college, one slogan echoed louder than any other: 
        <strong>Cram. Pass. Forget. (CPF).</strong>  
        It was more than a saying — it was a trap. Students pushed through every semester, 
        memorizing just enough to pass exams, only to forget everything once the new semester began.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the final years — when we were expected to design real-world solutions — 
        most of us could barely recall <strong>10% of what we had learned</strong>.  
        The result? Good GPAs, but a fragile knowledge base. Mediocre projects. Missed opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was no exception. But when I shared concepts with classmates, they suddenly became 
        <em>simple, practical, and even exciting</em>. The problem wasn’t the material — 
        it was how it was taught and connected to real life.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why <strong>Hultralabs.com</strong> was born:  
        to break the CPF cycle by making engineering knowledge stick, 
        turning abstract ideas into tools for solving today’s challenges, 
        and empowering students, innovators, and problem-solvers worldwide.
